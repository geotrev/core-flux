## API

<h3 id="createstore"><code>createStore(initialSate, reducer, bindSubscriber, bindState)</code></h3>

The one and only export of Core Flux. Use it to create a store instance. You can create as few or as many stores as your heart desires! They will all be independent from one another.

The function **requires** all four of its arguments, as shown here:

```js
// foo-store.js

import { createStore } from "core-flux"
import { reducer, bindSubscriber, bindState } from "./foo-bindings"

const initialState = {
  foo: [],
  bar: { baz: 0, beep: "hello" },
}

const { subscribe, dispatch } = createStore(
  initialState,
  reducer,
  bindSubscriber,
  bindState
)

export { subscribe, dispatch }
```

Once a store is created, you'll be able to add subscriptions with `subscribe` and request state updates with `dispatch`.

#### Bindings

Here's a breakdown of each binding needed when initializing a new store:

**`reducer(state, action)`**

> `state (object)`: A _copy_ of the current state object.<br/>`action ({ type: string, payload: object })`: The dispatched action type and its payload.

Creates a new version of state and returns it, based on the `type` and `payload`. If the return value is falsy, the update process ends.

**`bindSubscriber(newSubscription, state)`**

> `newSubscription ([subscriber, data])`: A tuple containing the subscribed object and its state-relational data.<br/>`state (object)`: A _copy_ of the current state object.

Called after a new `subscribe` call is made and a subscription has been added to the store. Use it to set initial state on the new subscriber based on the `data` defined by your subscriber.

**`bindState(subscriptions, reducedState, setState)`**

> `subscriptions (subscription[])`: An array containing all subscriptions.<br/>`reducedState (object)`: The state object as returned by the reducer.<br/>`setState (function)`:

Called after the reducer has processed the next state value. Use it to set the reduced state back to subscribers **and** back to the store.

<h3 id="subscribe"><code>subscribe(subscriber, data)</code></h3>

Adds a subscription to your store. It will always be tied to a single store, and subsequently state object.

```js
import { subscribe } from "./foo-store"

class FooItems {
  constructor() {
    subscribe(this, ["foo"])
  }

  get items() {
    return this.foo
  }
}
```

In the above example, we've designed the subscriber, the `FooItems` class, to declare an array of strings correlating to properties in the store's state. If you're from the Redux world, this is akin to "connecting" a consumer to a provider via higher-order function/component.

After the subscribe call is made, your `bindSubscriber` function will be called where you can pass along the default values as you see fit.

> In general, you should try to use a simple data structure as the second argument to `subscribe`; this ensures your bindings have generic and consistent expectations.

<h3 id="dispatch"><code>dispatch(type, payload)</code></h3>

Requests a state change in your store.

We can extend the previous example with a setter to call `dispatch`:

```js
import { subscribe, dispatch } from "./foo-store"

class FooItems {
  constructor() {
    subscribe(this, ["foo"])
  }

  get items() {
    return this.foo
  }

  addItem(item) {
    dispatch("ADD_ITEM", { item })
  }
}

const fooBar = new FooItems()
fooBar.addItem("bop")
```

Now when the `addItem` method is called, Core Flux will pass along the action type and payload to your reducer.

The reducer could have a logic branch on the action type called `ADD_ITEM` which adds the given item to state, then returns the resulting new state (containing the full items list).

Finally, the result would then be handed over to your `bindState` binding.

> Much like in `subscribe`, it's best to maintain data types in the payload so your reducer can have consistent expectations.

## Exposing the store

For utility or debugging reasons, you may want to look at the store you're working with. To do so, you can use the `__data` property when creating a store.

```js
const fooStore = createStore(initialState, reducer, bindSubscriber, bindState)

window.fooStoreData = fooStore.__data

console.log(window.fooStoreData) // { state: {...}, subscriptions: [...] }
```

## Data model

Core Flux has a relatively simple data model that you should understand when creating your bindings.

Here is how state looks in all cases:

```js
Store {
  state: { ... },
  subscriptions: [
    [subscriber, data],
    [subscriber, data],
    [subscriber, data],
    // ...
  ]
}
```

Each item in `subscriptions` contains a `subscriber` and some form of `data` that informs a relationship between `state` and `subscriber`.

NOTE: You define `data` in the above model, be it an object, array, string; it can be anything you want. Ultimately, you're responsible for communicating state relationships to subscribers.

## Data flow

Here is the general lifecycle of subscribing to the store & dispatching a state update.

- `subscribe` > `bindSubscriber`
- `dispatch` > `reducer` > `bindState`
